*** The notebook uploaded has the outputs saved already.
*** it should be noted that im and ina files means IMAGE DATASET.
*** im is used for multiclass classification and ina is used for binary classification
*** similarly dm represents files and weights of direct readings where 
*** dm is used for multiclass classification and dna is used for binary classification
*** download the CSV files using the following links

1. Testing the Machine Learning Algorithm
-> open the corresponding folder and find the jupiter notebook.
-> open the notebook in Google Colab.
-> Upload the CSV files from the Direct Readings and Image Dataset Folder.
-> Run the cells.
 
2. Testing the Neural Networks
-> Open the corresponding folder and find the notebook to test the model.
-> Open the Notebook in Colab.
-> connect to GPU.
-> Upload the weights folder (.pth file).
-> upload the CSV files.
-> Run the cells.
-> If the keys are matched the cells run successfully and output is generated.

3. Training and Testing the Neural Network 
-> Open the folder and find the jupiter notebook.
-> Open the notebook using colab.
*** connect to GPU if for testing the Direct reading classifications using the NEural Network.
-> Upload the CSV file.
-> Run the cells.

4. testing the augmentation
-> open the notebook in colab.
-> upload the sample images provided.
-> a CSV file is saved at the end of the execution.
